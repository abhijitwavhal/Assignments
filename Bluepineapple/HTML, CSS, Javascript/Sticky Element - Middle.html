        <h2>Hyper Text Markup Language</h2>
        <p>
            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
            in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
            languages such as JavaScript.

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
            for the appearance of the document.

            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
            interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
            documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and
            other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly
            introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and
            may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the
            content of the page.

            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
            content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
            Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged
            the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to
            display video and audio, primarily using the element, in collaboration with JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h2>Cascading Style Sheet</h2>
        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
            written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1]
            CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
            fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
            specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
            the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
            and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file
            and its formatting.

            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
            styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or
            screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
            content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more
            than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
            technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on
            the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have
            a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
            programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
            and the Document Object Model (DOM).

            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
            facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers
            and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
            languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

        <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
        <p>
            Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web
            pages (as opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply
            Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether
            the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides
            basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form
            elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap
            to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and
            dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.

            Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components which do not require other libraries like jQuery.
            They provide additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, progress bars, navigation
            drop-downs, and carousels. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in
            some cases accompanying JavaScript code. They also extend the functionality of some existing interface
            elements, including for example an auto-complete function for input fields.

            Example of a webpage using Bootstrap framework rendered in Firefox
            The most prominent components of Bootstrap are its layout components, as they affect an entire web page. The
            basic layout component is called "Container", as every other element in the page is placed in it. Developers
            can choose between a fixed-width container and a fluid-width container. While the latter always fills the
            width with the web page, the former uses one of the five predefined fixed widths, depending on the size of
            the screen showing the page:[citation needed]

            Smaller than 576 pixels
            576–768 pixels
            768–992 pixels
            992–1200 pixels
            Larger than 1200 pixels
            Once a container is in place, other Bootstrap layout components implement a CSS Flexbox layout through
            defining rows and columns.

            A precompiled version of Bootstrap is available in the form of one CSS file and three JavaScript files that
            can be readily added to any project. The raw form of Bootstrap, however, enables developers to implement
            further customization and size optimizations. This raw form is modular, meaning that the developer can
            remove unneeded components, apply a theme and modify the uncompiled Sass files.

        <h2>jQuery</h2>
        <p>
            jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as
            event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.[3] It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT
            License.[4] As of Aug 2022, jQuery is used by 77% of the 10 million most popular websites.[5] Web analysis
            indicates that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin, having at least 3 to 4
            times more usage than any other JavaScript library.[5][6]

            jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create
            animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers
            to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for
            low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. The modular
            approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.

            The set of jQuery core features—DOM element selections, traversal, and manipulation—enabled by its selector
            engine (named "Sizzle" from v1.3), created a new "programming style", fusing algorithms and DOM data
            structures. This style influenced the architecture of other JavaScript frameworks like YUI v3 and Dojo,
            later stimulating the creation of the standard Selectors API.[7]

            Microsoft and Nokia bundle jQuery on their platforms.[8] Microsoft includes it with Visual Studio[9] for use
            within Microsoft's ASP.NET AJAX and ASP.NET MVC frameworks while Nokia has integrated it into the Web
            Run-Time widget development platform.[10]

        <h2>AJAX</h2>
        <p>
            Ajax (also AJAX /ˈeɪdʒæks/; short for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML")[1][2] is a set of web development
            techniques that uses various web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications.
            With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background)
            without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange
            layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and, by extension, web applications, to change
            content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.[3] In practice, modern implementations
            commonly utilize JSON instead of XML.

            Ajax is not a technology, but rather a programming concept. HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark
            up and style information. The webpage can be modified by JavaScript to dynamically display—and allow the
            user to interact with the new information. The built-in XMLHttpRequest object is used to execute Ajax on
            webpages, allowing websites to load content onto the screen without refreshing the page. Ajax is not a new
            technology, nor is it a new language. Instead, it is existing technologies used in a new way.
